Solution 1: Microservice Architecture with Message Queue  
Architecture Overview
Built as a distributed system with event-driven ingestion and processing.

Services
Ingestor Service:
Calls the Polygon.io API every hour.
Publishes raw news JSON to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ / Azure Service Bus).

Enrichment Service:
Listens to the queue.
Enriches each news item (charts, NLP, metadata).
Saves to MongoDB (schema-flexible).

API Gateway (ASP.NET Core):
Forwards client requests to the News API service.
Handles authentication and routing.

News API Service:
RESTful service.
Implements endpoints a–f (as listed in your prompt).
Communicates with MongoDB.
Optional Subscription Notification Service:
Sends updates to users based on preferences.

Future: email, push, WebSocket, or webhook.
